# PokedexDatabase
Pokedex Database using MySQL and Node.js


This is a collaborative project between Austin Henry and Jordan Sturtz. 
This website successfully implemented CRUD capabilities using MySQL and Node.Js. It functions as a Pokedex
from the popular Pokemon series. The user is able to insert,update, or delete pokemon data into this Pokedex.
Additionally, the user can sort the Pokemon on the read page in order to see Pokemon based on stats.
